# ‚õ©Ô∏è Fusion Gateway

[![Foundry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Foundry-FF0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=foundry)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)

A modular framework for the Rialo blockchain that enables smart contracts to connect with real-world data from any HTTPS-based API, eliminating the need for traditional oracles for many common use cases.

---

## üìñ Overview

The Fusion Gateway aims to unlock programmable reactivity and real-world connectivity for Rialo smart contracts. By providing a native, on-chain mechanism to fetch and process external data, we empower developers to build applications that are more dynamic, responsive, and connected to the world outside the blockchain.

The framework is composed of several key modules:

-   **`FusionLinker.sol`**: The core HTTP fetcher that initiates `GET` and `POST` requests.
-   **`Sanctifier.sol`**: A data validation and cleaning utility.
-   **`Wardstone.sol`**: An access control and security module for managing API keys and rate limits.
-   **`SchemaForge.sol`**: A registry for managing and reusing API endpoint definitions.
-   **`LoreHooks.sol`**: An optional narrative layer for triggering on-chain events from data.

For a more detailed explanation of the architecture, see the `docs/` directory.
